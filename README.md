## **Project Name:** Lingua Mystica

### **Description**

**Lingua Mystica** is an innovative **prototype tool** designed to decode and translate ancient languages, including Sanskrit, Sumerian, Egyptian Hieroglyphs, Akkadian, Ancient Greek, Latin, Phoenician, and Aramaic. The tool combines **coding, structured language data, and AI-powered translation** to make ancient scripts accessible for students, researchers, and enthusiasts.

Lingua Mystica provides historical context, script examples, and translations, bridging the gap between archaeology, education, and technology. The project demonstrates how AI and programming can be applied to **real-world archaeological challenges**, making it a perfect fit for the FLL "Unearthed" challenge.

### **Features**

* **AI-Powered Translation:** Translates text from ancient languages to modern languages.
* **Historical Context:** Provides information on scripts, character sets, example words, and the history of each language.
* **Interactive Interface:** Users select source and target languages and view translations in a clear, readable format.
* **Prototype Design:** Demonstrates the feasibility of combining technology and archaeology for educational purposes.
* **Multi-Language Support:** Supports translations to English, Arabic, French, and Spanish.

---

### **Technologies Used**

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **APIs:** AI language model API for translations
* **Data Management:** Structured language metadata (scripts, examples, history)
* **Interactivity:** Dynamic updates using JavaScript DOM manipulation and event listeners

---

### **Advantages**

* Makes ancient languages accessible to learners and researchers.
* Supports educational exploration of history and archaeology.
* Demonstrates practical application of coding, AI, and data management.
* Preserves cultural heritage digitally.

---

### **Limitations**

* Prototype may not handle complex sentences or damaged texts.
* AI translations may have minor inaccuracies.
* Requires internet access for API-based translations.

---

### **How It Works**

1. Select the **source language** (ancient script).
2. Select the **target language** (modern language for translation).
3. Enter the text to translate.
4. Click **“Decode & Translate”** to view the translation along with historical and script context.

---

### **Project Goals**

* Demonstrate how **AI and coding** can aid in archaeological research.
* Engage students in learning **ancient languages and history** interactively.
* Provide a **prototype** that could evolve into a full tool for museums, schools, and research centers.

---

### **Future Improvements**

* Implement OCR to decode handwritten or inscribed scripts directly from images.
* Support more modern and ancient languages.
* Add multi-word and full sentence translation capability.
* Integrate offline mode or local database for accessibility without internet.
